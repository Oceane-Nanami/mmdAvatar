Thank you for downloading Polly Polaris v1.0β!! Before using this model, here's a list of rules and regulations you should take note of first. Just remember that I'm not responsible for any damage and loss that may result from using this model. It's your own decision, and if you ignore this, then don't come complaining to me if Johnny Law comes knocking at your door.

*PLEASE NOTE THAT RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN FUTURE UPDATES.

Allowed:
- Editing (such as adding a new outfit or cosplaying, additional expressions, enhanced UV textures, remodelling it, etc.), but only if it stays the same character. 
- Always remember to give me (The UnNamed-P/SL1997/GheiBaikonStrips) credit for the original model data, even if the data has been modified or remodelled.
- Converting the model for use on another platform (XNALara, Garry's Mod or Source Filmmaker, GTA San Andreas or any other game that utilizes playermod hacks, and the like)
- Redistributing edits, as long as they don't infringe any of the rules listed below

Not, and must I repeat, NOT Allowed:
- Redistributing or trading the model in its original state
- Using parts of this model onto another, and vice-versa 
- Using the model for any explicit of pornographic material (R-18)
- Commercial use or anything that involves payment (i.e. PayPal, raffling her off for dA Points, etc.) Since she's owned by a professional Baseball team in Japan, they'd sue the living hell out of you for doing that kind of shit.
- Claiming direct ownership of the model or character. I smell a lawsuit. 

Thanks!! Just as a side note, there will be more updates to this model in the near future, which may be subject to a complete overhaul of the original data or newly created data from the ground up. I hope you enjoy your happy MMD life!! :D
